      <description>Hey There
I am Halim, a CS graduate turned PM, I love brainstorming new ideas, bringing people together and getting stuff done.
I have a strong interest in system design, cryptocurrencies, Decentralization and the future of humanity.
I got interested in Product Management after attending a Google Develper Conference in India in Nov 2016 where I saw various Google PMs launching new features and talking about their projects on stage.</description>
