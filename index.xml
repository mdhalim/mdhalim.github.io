      <description>On Writing Product Documentation If there is already a backlog of issues/bugs. The first should be to pick up the most pressing problems by talking to different stakeholders (Support/Sales/Marketing) and creating a priotization matrix ranking each issue based on the prioties assigned by different team.
 Drop-offs during Onboarding | Marketing |  Defining The Problem: Conversion sucks. 18% but should be able to do 30% (need source). What else have we tried here, and why is this worth trying?</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
