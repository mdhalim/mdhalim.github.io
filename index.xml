      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-signature&#34;&gt;Digital Signature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like a written signature of a document, but it&amp;rsquo;s in digital form. The desired features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only you can sign your own signature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone can verify your signature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A signature is tied to a certain document, it can&amp;rsquo;t be copied and used with other documents
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
